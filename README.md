The election determined the composition of the 17th Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged as the single largest party with a majority, and its leader, Narendra Modi, was re-elected as the Prime Minister of India. The election witnessed intense political campaigning, with various parties and alliances vying for seats across the country. It saw a high voter turnout, and the results had a profound impact on the country's political landscape.

All 543 elected MPs are elected from single-member constituencies using first-past-the-post voting.

Eligible voters must be Indian citizens, 18 or older than 18, an ordinary resident of the polling area of the constituency and registered to vote (name included in the electoral rolls), possess a valid voter identification card issued by the Election Commission of India or an equivalent. Some people convicted of electoral or other offences are barred from voting.
